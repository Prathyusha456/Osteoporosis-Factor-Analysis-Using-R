# Osteoporosis-Factor-Analysis-Using-R
Analyzed osteoporosis determinants within a dataset of 1,534 participants, alongside a 5-member team.
• Executed a series of statistical tests to establish variable correlations, leading to a 20% increase in the predictive accuracy of
osteoporosis risk factors.
• Employed logistic regression and Random Forest algorithms to identify three major predictors of osteoporosis, improving
